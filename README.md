## Service Delivery

To deliver a Django REST application to end users, follow these steps: Choose a hosting environment (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean), set up a server or use a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) if needed, prepare your application for production, use Git for version control, collect static files, configure your database and set up environment variables, set up a web server (Nginx or Apache) as a reverse proxy, configure your domain and DNS settings, apply database migrations, manage secrets using environment variables, establish firewall and security measures, conduct testing in the production environment, and consider deployment automation and CI/CD pipelines. To monitor the service and streamline maintenance, implement monitoring and logging tools, consider scaling for growth, and ensure regular updates. Popular tools used for this process include Git for version control, Nginx or Apache as web servers, Let's Encrypt for HTTPS, and Fabric or Ansible for deployment automation. By following these steps and using the mentioned tools, you can successfully deliver the Movie Rating Django REST application to end users while ensuring security and scalability.


## Use of ChatGPT

Chat GPT was used during the creation this this document as it allowed quick summarization and idea generation for how this service could be devliverd. Chat GPT was not used during development as I find it often gets code wrong which takes longer to debug over just writing it yourself.
